/// Compression levels for available compression methods.

/// <remarks>
/// The zstd compression library provides in-memory compression
/// and decompression functions.
/// The library supports regular compression levels from 1 up to ZSTD_maxCLevel(),
/// which is currently 22. Levels >= 20, labeled `--ultra`, should be used with
/// caution, as they require more memory. The library also offers negative
/// compression levels, which extend the range of speed vs.ratio preferences.
/// The lower the level, the faster the speed (at the cost of compression).
